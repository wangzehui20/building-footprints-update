# Building footprints Update
This code is implemented for the article "Learning color distributions from bitemporal remote sensing images to update existing building footprints" 
### image-color-translation
The difference between the data distributions of different time-phase images is reduced using the image color translation method
### semantic-segmentation
Semantic segmentation model predicts the segmentation results of the images from the latest period
### post-processing-update-strategy
Strictly retain the existing labels of unchanged regions to attain the updated results
